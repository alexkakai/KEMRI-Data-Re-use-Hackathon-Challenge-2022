# KEMRI-Data-Re-use-Hackathon-Challenge-2022

## Investigation Overview
><div style="text-align: justify"> Every five years, Kenyan politicians while seeking for elective office, promise the electorate to build new health facilities. However, counties directors of health services are finding it hard to maintain existing hospitals not mentioning the increased pressure to open new facilities.</div>

> <div style="text-align: justify"> The main purpose of this project is to optimize the hospitals' location,functionality, expansion space and workflow insights to bring out new messages to speak to politicians and counties' directors of health.</div>

## Dataset Overview

> The dataset contained data from Murang'a county that contains:
> * Physical status of the facilities (building structure, floors, furniture and plants),
> * Ownership of the institutions (public and private),
> * Annual workflow (i.e. number of patients who visited the facilities), 
> * Location of the facilities (physical land elevation in relation the mean sea level (meters)), 
> * Space availability (land for future expansion),
> * Level of the facilities (National Government Classification of Health Facilities), and 
> * Functionality of the facilities(Whether the facilities are offering the basic minimum health services as prescribed by national GoK policy and guidelines for various categories of health facilities).

## Key Insights
> <div style="text-align: justify"> Majority of the facilities are in good condition i.e. the building structure, floors, furniture and plants. Likewise these facilities have sufficient space for expansion. Therefore, we do not need to building new facilities but rather expand the existing facilities.</div>

> <div style="text-align: justify"> Only 7.5% of the health facilities are in good condition while only 5% of the facilities have sufficient installed capacity that can offer the basic minimum health services. This shows that majority of the facilities have below par conditions and under installed capicity. Therefore, more effort should go towards improving the conditions and installing more capacity than building new facilities.</div>

> <div style="text-align: justify"> Dispensaries which are the most constructed facilities experience the least workload/visits across the year.These dispensaries are the highest in terms of facilities with below par conditions and have under installed capacity to offer basic minimum health services. Patients shurn dispensaries and prefer to visit to Sub District hospitals which have sufficient installed capacity and good functionality.  Therefore efforts should go towards improving the dispensaries condtions, this will reduce workload towards the much bigger hospitals. </div>


> <div style="text-align: justify"> Patients seems to prefer visiting Sub District hospitals whose location (land elevation) is below 1200m above sea level. When constructing bigger hospital in the future, this is a factor worth considering. Construction to be be done around regions whose elevation is not that high.</div>
